### Reading Questions

*from [Khera et al., 2021](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2777055)*

1. The authors develop machine learning models to predict death after acute myocardial infarction. The shape of the dataset used to develop these models may be described as:
  - N &#8811; P, i.e. many more patients than features
  - N &#8810; P, i.e. many more features than patients
  - N &asymp; P, i.e. approximately as many patients as features
2. The machine learning models showed improved calibration compared to logistic regression. In this setting, which of the following best describes good calibration?
  - mortality risk predicted by the model is a good estimate of true mortality risk
  - features determined to be important by the model are consistent with clinical understanding
3. Which of the following best describes the authors' final strategy for imputing missing categorical variables?
  - A new category was created for these values. In other words, "missing" was viewed as a value of the variable.
  - Missing values were predicted based on the values of the other predictors for that patient.
  - Missing values were assigned to the category most commonly observed in the dataset.
  - Missing values were assigned to the average value for that variable.
