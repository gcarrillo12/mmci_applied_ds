### Reading Questions

<!-- *from [Khera et al., 2021](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2777055)*

1. The authors develop machine learning models to predict death after acute myocardial infarction. The shape of the dataset used to develop these models may be described as:
  - N &#8811; P, i.e. many more patients than features
  - N &#8810; P, i.e. many more features than patients
  - N &asymp; P, i.e. approximately as many patients as features
2. Models were (correctly) tested on data that was not used during model development.
  - True
  - False
3. The machine learning models showed improved calibration compared to logistic regression. In this setting, which of the following best describes good calibration?
  - There is high overlap between the features determined to be important by the model and the features clinicians believe are important.
  - Mortality risk predicted by the model is a good estimate of true mortality risk.
  - Calibration is another term for discrimination performance. In other words, models with high area under the sensitivity/specificity curve are well calibrated.
4. Which of the following best describes the authors' final strategy for imputing missing categorical variables?
  - A new category was created for these values. In other words, "missing" was viewed as a value of the variable.
  - Missing values were predicted based on the values of the other predictors for that patient.
  - Missing values were assigned to the category most commonly observed in the dataset.
  - Missing values were assigned to the average value for that variable.
5. Which of the following models do *the authors* claim is interpretable?
  - The LASSO model, because it is a generalized linear model
  - The neural network, because new approaches have been developed to understand the importance of individual features
  - The XGBoost model, because it is based on a collection of decision trees
  - The meta-classifier, because its decisions are based on all of the previous 3 models

6. According to the authors, machine learning offers greatest benefit when applied to which of the following?
  - data with rich spatial or temporal structure
  - a limited number of distinct clinical measurements
  - datasets in which most variables are categorical rather than numeric
7. Benefits of machine learning are most clear for which of the following health data modalities?
  - data from large-scale observational studies (e.g. Framingham)
  - electronic health records
  - radiological images
8. In the current era of big data, logistic regression is obsolete.
  - True
  - False
9. Generalized linear models offer all of the following advantages except:
  - they are familiar to most practitioners
  - the effect of features on predictions is easy to understand
  - they have a clear causal interpretation
  - they are easy to implement
10. Which of the following most accurately represents the authors' perspective?
  - complex machine learning models should not be explored except when working with data modalities for which they have proven benefit
  - complex machine learning models should be explored, but used only when benefits outweigh the costs
  - complex machine learning models are almost always superior to older approaches

### Discussion Questions

1. Khera et al. repeatedly emphasize the importance of interpretability, and we have discussed multiple perspectives on interpretability in class. Do you believe model interpretability is important? Why or why not? And regardless, do you believe that models commonly claimed to be interpretable truly are?
2. When developing a predictive model, machine learning practitioners often use whatever data is available rather than a curated set of predictors. The article by [Rajkomer et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-018-0029-1) (recommended but not required) provides an excellent example of this. What are the dangers of using *all* the data, and do they outweigh its advantages?
