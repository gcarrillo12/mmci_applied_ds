# Applied Data Science Final Project

Deliverable(s) | Due Date
--- | ---
Proposal | Friday at 7:59am ET, start of weekend 4
Report & Slides | Friday at 7:59am ET, start of weekend 6

## Team Assignment: 
Propose a data science research project related to a clinical topic of your choosing. The project you propose should use techniques from at least one of the topics discussed in class (e.g. multilayer perceptron, computer vision, natural language processing, time-series modeling, reinforcement learning). Deliverables will be:
1. an initial pre-proposal, which must be approved by the instructor
2. a final report, formatted as a brief research proposal/grant; and
3. a short (15-minute) presentation summarizing your proposal.
Note that you do not need to complete the research project that you propose; your deliverable is the proposal itself.

## Pre-proposal (1 page):
Prepare a brief, informal document with the following elements:
- a brief description of the clinical problem you would like to address
- why you believe a data science approach is appropriate
- possible data sources for model development; note that you *can* propose new data collection
- initial thoughts on which statistical / machine learning approaches are most appropriate

## Report (>3 pages, single-spaced):
Prepare a formal document, formatted as a brief research proposal/grant, that includes the following elements:

### Background and Significance (1 page): 
Describe the clinical problem, its importance, and the need for the data science approach you are proposing. This should include a brief literature review (>10 scientific articles) establishing the significance of the problem and describing relevant methods, including any statistical or machine learning models that have been applied previously. What recent innovations or developments have made this approach possible? These might relate to new data resources, new data science techniques, or new clinical insights.

### Objective(s) (<.5 pages):
Concisely state 2-4 objectives/aims of your project. In most cases, this should include a brief summary of the predictive model you intend to develop and at least one specific hypothesis related to its prediction performance. This hypothesis should include the type of model, its inputs and outputs, and proposed performance metrics. In addition to model performance, aims might relate to (a) data acquisition, (b) data exploration, (c) comparison to expert/human performance, (d) implementation feasibility, or (e) model-based intervention effectiveness, to give a few examples.

### Approach (2-3 pages):
Describe the steps that would be taken to carry out your project, including the following:
- **Data acquisition.** Your project can use an existing data source or propose a new data collection. If you propose a new study, please describe its design as briefly as possible and focus on the resulting data.
- **Data preprocessing.** Describe initial processing that would be conducted prior to modeling. These details should convey your strong understanding of the data source(s) you propose to use and/or develop, including the number and type of variables that will be available and details regarding missingness (or lack thereof).
- **Model development.** Describe your proposed model and outline steps required to develop it. If you will be using or modifying a previously-developed architecture, please cite it. This section should be tangible and detailed. For example, all architecture details and model hyperparameters should be specified. Vague statements like "we will use a CNN" will receive no credit.
- **Model training and evaluation.** Provide a training and evaluation plan based on (a) cross-validation or (b) a fixed data partition, as appropriate. Justify your choice. If a tuning set is needed, describe how it will be used. List and justify *all* performance metrics and describe how your hypothesis(-es) will be evaluated.

## Presentation (15 minutes):
Each group will give a 15-minute presentation followed by 5 minutes of Q&A on the last day of class. The presentation should include approximately 5 minutes of background, a brief description of objectives, and approximately 10 minutes describing the approach, with emphasis on model development and evaluation.

## Grading:

Standards | Exemplary (8-10) | Satisfactory (4-7) | Unacceptable (0-3) | Weight
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Background | The clinical motivation is compelling and the project is timely and/or novel. | The clinical motivation is present, but portions may be unclear or inadequately researched. | The clinical motivation is underdeveloped and the contribution of the project is questionable. | x2
Objectives | Objectives are stated precisely and well-aligned to the clinical problem. | Objectives are aligned to the problem, but some elements are not adequately described. | Objectives do not follow from the background; no clear way to evaluate success/failure. | x1
Data Collection and Preprocessing | Data sources have been adequately researched; or the proposed study is feasible. | The data can be obtained but important details are missing. | Acquiring the necessary data is infeasible. | x1
Model Development | The proposed model draws on appropriate, current data science techniques and the development process is clearly outlined. | The proposed model uses older or suboptimal methods, and/or the path to development has not been adequately described. | The proposed model is not matched to the data and/or project objectives. | x1
Model Evaluation | Performance metrics are clearly described; evaluation plan is justified and aligns with objectives. | Some relevant statistical considerations have not been adequately discussed; some mismatch between objectives and evaluation. | Evaluation plan reflects poor understanding of relevant principles, or important details are missing. | x1
Presentation | The project rationale and approach are precisely described with appropriate use of visuals to enhance. | The project rationale and approach are described, but some details are not clear. | The project rationale is not clear and/or the approach is not adequately described. | x3
Response to Questions | Demonstrates full knowledge of topic; explains and elaborates on all questions. | Shows ease in answering questions but does not elaborate. | Answers are unclear or underdeveloped; may not understand the questions. | x1
