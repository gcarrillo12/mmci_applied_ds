# Applied Data Science Final Project

Deliverable(s) | Due Date
--- | ---
Proposal | Friday at 7:59am ET, start of Block 3
Report & Slides | Friday at 7:59am ET, start of Block 6

## Team Assignment: 
Propose a data science research project related to a clinical topic of your choosing. Your project should use techniques from at least one of the topics discussed in class (e.g. multilayer perceptron, computer vision, natural language processing, time-series modeling, reinforcement learning). Deliverables will be:
1. an initial project proposal, which must be approved by the instructor
2. (b) a final report, formatted as a brief research proposal/grant; and
3. (c) a short (15-minute) presentation.

## Background and Significance (1 page): 
Describe the clinical problem, its importance, and the need for the data science approach you are proposing. This should include a brief literature review (>10 scientific articles) establishing the significance of the problem and describing relevant methods, including any statistical or machine learning models that have been applied previously. What recent innovations or developments have made this approach possible? These might relate to new data resources, new data science techniques, or new clinical insights.

## Objective(s) (<.5 pages):
Concisely state 2-4 objectives/aims of your project. In most cases, this should include a brief summary of the predictive model you intend to develop and at least one specific hypothesis related to its prediction performance. This hypothesis should include the type of model, its inputs and outputs, and proposed performance metrics. In addition to model performance, aims might relate to (a) data acquisition, (b) data exploration, (c) comparison to expert/human performance, (d) implementation feasibility, or (e) model-based intervention effectiveness, to give a few examples.

## Approach (2-3 pages):
Describe the steps that would be taken to carry out your project, including the following:
- **Data acquisition.** Your project can use an existing data source or propose a new data collection. If you propose a new study, please describe its design as briefly as possible and focus on the resulting data.
- **Data preprocessing.** Describe initial processing that would be conducted prior to modeling. These details should convey your strong understanding of the data source(s) you propose to use and/or develop, including the number and type of variables that will be available and details regarding missingness (or lack thereof).
- **Model development.** Describe your proposed model and outline steps required to develop it. If you will be using or modifying a previously-developed architecture, please cite it. This section should be tangible and detailed. For example, all architecture details and model hyperparameters should be specified. Vague statements like "we will use a CNN" will receive no credit.
- **Model training and evaluation.** Provide a training and evaluation plan based on (a) cross-validation or (b) a fixed data partition, as appropriate. Justify your choice. If a tuning set is needed, describe how it will be used. List and justify *all* performance metrics and describe how your hypothesis(-es) will be evaluated.

## Presentation (15 minutes):
Each group will give a 15-minute presentation followed by 5 minutes of Q&A on the last day of class. The presentation should include approximately 5 minutes of background, a brief description of objectives, and approximately 10 minutes describing the approach, with emphasis on model development and evaluation. 

## Grading:
