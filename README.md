# Applied Data Science
*Master of Management in Clinical Informatics (MMCi) Program*

**Course Director:** Matthew Engelhard

## Course Materials

- **[Please review the syllabus by clicking here](https://github.com/mengelhard/mmci_applied_ds/blob/master/syllabus.md)**
- Materials for each course weekend (*i.e.,* block) are linked in the *Schedule* below

### Readings and Quizzes
- There will be a quiz due before blocks 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- Each quiz (see *Schedule*) links to two articles that should be read before taking it.
- All articles are also available as .pdf in the *Resources* section of [Sakai](https://sakai.duke.edu).
- Your answers must be entered in the *Tests and Quizzes* section of [Sakai](https://sakai.duke.edu) before the beginning of class.
- Quizzes are pass/fail. To pass, you must answer all questions correctly. However, there is no limit to the number of times the quizzes may be taken.

### Computational Assignments
- whatever

### Final Project
- The course will culminate in a design project in which you propose to apply data science methods to a clinical topic of your choosing.
- Project instructions are [here](https://github.com/mengelhard/mmci_applied_ds/blob/master/final_project.md), and the grading scheme is [here](https://github.com/mengelhard/mmci_applied_ds/blob/master/final_project_grading.md).
- **Proposals are due** before class on weekend/block 3, and the **project is due** before class on weekend/block 6.
