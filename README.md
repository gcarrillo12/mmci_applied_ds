# Applied Data Science
*Master of Management in Clinical Informatics (MMCi) Program*

**Course Director:** Matthew Engelhard

## Course Materials

- **[Please review the syllabus by clicking here](https://github.com/mengelhard/mmci_applied_ds/blob/master/syllabus.md)**
- Materials for each course weekend (*i.e.,* block) are linked in the *Schedule* below

### Readings and Quizzes
- There will be a quiz due before blocks 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- Each quiz (see *Schedule*) links to two articles that should be read before taking it.
- All articles are also available as .pdf in the *Resources* section of [Sakai](https://sakai.duke.edu).
- Your answers must be entered in the *Tests and Quizzes* section of [Sakai](https://sakai.duke.edu) before the beginning of class.
- Quizzes are pass/fail. To pass, you must answer all questions correctly. However, there is no limit to the number of times the quizzes may be taken.

### Computational Assignments
- There will be four computational assignments due before blocks 2, 3, 5, and 6.
- Each assignment will present code + output and ask you to interpret what you see based on principles from class.
- Assignments can be viewed in your web browser, and **you will not need to code** to complete them.
- If you *do* have coding experience, however, you are encouraged to explore further on your own by modifying the code.
- For those who want to explore further, we recommend either [installing Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) or working in [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com).
- Recommended Python resources include [Duke library tutorials](https://library.duke.edu/data/tutorials), [Python Crash Course book](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Eric-Matthes-ebook/dp/B07J4521M3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=Python+book&qid=1618331896&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzSVNYTDhDUExZQktDJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODgwNjQwM0RNT0U2Nk9XTDdDQiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTg4NjEyODc5U0ZROVNEQkZEJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==), and [Google Python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/).

### Final Project
- The course will culminate in a design project in which you propose to apply data science methods to a clinical topic of your choosing.
- Project instructions are [here](https://github.com/mengelhard/mmci_applied_ds/blob/master/final_project.md), and the grading scheme is [here](https://github.com/mengelhard/mmci_applied_ds/blob/master/final_project_grading.md).
- **Proposals are due** before class on weekend/block 3, and the **project is due** before class on weekend/block 6.
